There is a file called runtests.py at top level
 
execute this file with python and it will perform all of the unittests in the tests/ directory.                                                                                                                    
 
If you want to add a new test file, just add an import line to the top of this file.
 
Remember to start all your test functions with test_ otherwise unittest will ignore it
